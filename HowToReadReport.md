## 📊 How to Read the Report

Each email is designed to give you a "Buy/Wait" decision in under 10 seconds. Here is the breakdown of what the data points mean:

### 1. Perth Mint Status
* **OPEN**: The physical trading room at 310 Hay Street is active.
* **Bullion Trading closed on Sunday**: Trading is unavailable, though the gift shop and tours may be open.
* **Public Holiday**: Named holidays where the Mint is closed (e.g., Labour Day).
* **Web pricing unavailable**: The Mint has paused digital pricing due to volatility; you must visit the store for a quote.

### 2. Market vs. Retail Price
* **Market Spot**: The global "paper" price of gold per gram.
* **Official 1g/5g Price**: The actual price you pay for the physical minted bar.
    * *Tip: The 5g bar usually has a lower "premium" per gram than the 1g bar.*

### 3. Strategy Indicators (Moving Averages)
* **50-Day Average**: Represents the medium-term price trend. If the current price is **5% below** this line, the script marks the email as **!! URGENT !!**.
* **200-Day Average**: The "Floor." If the price drops near this line, it is considered a historically significant low and a strong entry point.



### 4. Strategy & Action
* **Bilingual Report**: Detailed breakdown of spot prices and retail costs in both AUD and RMB.
* **Mandarin Report**: Streamlined version for the secondary email focusing on essential data and the 200-day "Bull/Bear" line.
* **The "Gold Passbook"**: Every time an email is sent, the script logs the data to `gold_passbook.csv`. You can open this in Excel to track historical premiums over time.
